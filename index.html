      <h2>I use my passion for social science to build things people love</h2>

      <p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve been creating things. From electronic toys when I was
        young to winning programs for multi million-dollar companies in my professional life, I’ve
        always been a builder that is up for any challenge.</p>

      <p>Now I know I have about twenty more seconds to impress you, so
        let me cut to the chase: I’ve been an educator, writer, and content designer that has made a career out of
        spending time in the trenches learning as much as I can. So here are the skills that I think will
        make me great for a position in your organization:</p>

      <p>Training: I not only write training material, but I also design courses and write for professional
        audiences like you.</p>

      <p>Troubleshooting: I’m so used to no day or second being the same in my professional life
        that, when an issue pops up, I actively think on my feet to solve the problem instead of going
        into crisis mode.</p>

      <p>Research I’ve spent my career smashing issues with proactive plans backed by academic
        research.</p>

      <p>IT: While I know my technical skills are a hard sell, I worked in networking, help desk, digital
        marketing, and have mastered the standard software suites (CRM, Excel, Word) in my
        teaching career.</p>

      <p>Writing: I’ve had the great pleasure of writing curriculum, guides, SOPs, and marketing copy,
        and I’ve taught it all: tone, mood, inference, em dashes, and college composition. I know that
        words matter outside of the classroom too, and I can help you pick the right ones to grow your
        business.</p>

      <p>Thank you for visiting my profile. My work experience, coupled with my affinity for building better products, would make me the right choice for your company. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect.</p>

      <p>Thanks,
        Jordan Lynn</p>
